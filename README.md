**💬 WhatsApp UI Clone (Flutter)**

This project is a Flutter UI clone of WhatsApp, created for learning and practicing Flutter layout, theming, and widget structuring. It replicates the visual interface of WhatsApp including tabs for Chats, Status, Calls, and a placeholder for Camera, all implemented with clean, reusable Flutter widgets.

**📱 Features (UI Only)**

🔄 TabBar Navigation (Camera, Chats, Status, Calls)

🧾 Scrollable Chat List with avatars, messages, and timestamps

🟢 Status screen UI with recent and viewed updates

📞 Call screen UI with incoming/outgoing icons

📷 Placeholder Camera screen

🌗 WhatsApp-like theming (colors, spacing, font sizes)

⚠️ Note: This is a UI clone only — no real chat or backend functionality is implemented.
